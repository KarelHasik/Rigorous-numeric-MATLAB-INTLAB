# Verified MATLAB Code for [Global stability of Wright-type equations with negative Schwarzian]

This repository contains MATLAB scripts developed to support the results presented in our mathematical paper. The computations use **rigorous numerics** 
to confirm theoretical findings and are implemented using **[INTLAB](https://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/rump/intlab/)**, a toolbox for verified numerical computations in MATLAB.

## üßÆ Purpose

The provided code rigorously verifies the conclusions of various lemmas and theorems using interval arithmetic and validated numerics. 
These computations are essential for confirming key analytical results in our paper.

## üìÅ File Organization

- All files were written in MATLAB and make use of the INTLAB toolbox.
- File names correspond either to:
  - The **notation of specific mathematical functions** used in the paper, or
  - The **lemmas and theorems** whose conclusions are verified by the code.
- This naming convention allows readers to easily match each file to the relevant section of the paper.

## üõ† Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with version XX.X or later)
- [INTLAB toolbox](https://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/rump/intlab/) (make sure it's properly installed and initialized)
